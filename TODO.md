# List of stuff to be done (maybe use Node tools for it later on)

## Smart Contract

- add a button for the matchmaking, and support for the call in solana.rs
- redeploy a new stack, create multiple accounts and register them
- verify the arena match get triggered at 6 participants
- maybe start looking into trdelnik for integration testing on devnet?
